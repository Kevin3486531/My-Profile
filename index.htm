<h1 style="background-color:mediumaquamarine;"> My Profile</h1>

<p style="color:maroon;">
My name is Kevin Zhu and I am Australian with a Chinese background. <br>
I am studying currently information technology at RMIT and have been studying at RMIT since 2014 <br>
I originally chose at RMIT because I liked how the university allowed students to dive straight into specialized fields and get practical experience. <br>
My hobbies involve gaming and playing music on piano and bass, although I am very rusty on the former and still need a lot more time on the latter.
I am currently attempting to program a simple game but have been hitting many walls due to inexperience in many areas.

<h1 style="background-color:mediumaquamarine;">Interests in IT</h1>

<p style="color:maroon;">
I was originally in my second semester of industrial design, but the pandemic prevented me from completing the course. <br>
I used the spare time I had to work with software that was based off the python scripting language, which got me interested in starting a degree in IT. <br>
Furthermore, I was quite confident that IT would have plenty of courses that could be taught online, which would be very important for at least a few months. <br>

<h1 style="background-color:mediumaquamarine;">Ideal Job</h1>

<p style="color:maroon;">
My ideal job would involve having about 20-40 hours a week. <br>
Ideally, it should not take more than 40 minutes to get to if I were using a car. <br>
I do not think I would mind if there was not too much flexibility in the job. <br>
I am interested in almost any job related to IT. However, for someone with little to no work experience in that field, I am looking for helpdesk or junior engineer jobs in hopes to build a foundation to go further. <br>
Working in teams or solo each has their good and bad points and I do not prefer one over the other. <br>
Although I am introverted, if I am working in a group, or with a customer or client, I prefer to have the option to communicate with them frequently to continuously update with each other and avoid misunderstandings. <br>
Additionally, I would like to be able to gain work experience in the industry to better myself for future projects that I work on in teams or by myself in my own time.
