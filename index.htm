<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;"> My Profile</h1>

<p>
My name is Kevin Zhu.
I am Australian with a Chinese background and am studying information technology at RMIT. <br>
I originally chose at RMIT because I wanted to dive straight into specialized areas rather than study 3 years of science before specializing. <br>
My hobbies involve gaming and playing music on piano and bass. <br>
I am currently attempting to program a simple game but have been hitting many walls due to inexperience in many areas.

<h1>Interests in IT</h1>

<p style="color:red;">
This is a red paragraph. <br>
I was originally in my second semester of industrial design. However, the pandemic prevented me from completing the course. <br>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

<p style="background-color:tomato;">
My ideal job would involve having about 30-40 hours a week. <br>
Ideally, it should not take more than 40 minutes to get to if I were using a car. <br>
I do not mind if there was not too much flexibility in the job. <br>
I am interested in almost any job related to IT. However, I am looking for helpdesk or junior engineer jobs as I do not have much work experience yet. <br>
I have written documents and worked on projects both solo and in teams and do not especially prefer one over the other. <br>
Although I am an introvert, if I am working with a customer or client, I prefer to have the option to communicate with them frequently to avoid misunderstandings. <br>
Ideally, I would like to be able to gain work experience in the industry to be able to better myself for future projects that I work on in teams or by myself in my own time.
